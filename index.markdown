Hello! I'm a software engineer currently working on sandboxes at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/). Previously, I worked on the ticketing platform at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com), and before that, at [Wikimedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org), where I contributed to MediaWiki, the Wikipedia Android app, and various feature-supporting services.
