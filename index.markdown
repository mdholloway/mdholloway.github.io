I am a software engineer residing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

I currently work for the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org), where I have led API and service development for a number of features on Wikipedia and its mobile apps.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, [photography](https://flickr.com/photos/_mdh), outdoor recreation, and board gaming.
