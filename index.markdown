Hello! I'm a software engineer currently working on building out the [developer platform](https://developers.hubspot.com/) at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/). Previously, I worked at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com), where I focused on improving the reliability and performance of the support ticketing platform, and at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org), where I led API and service development to support new features on Wikipedia and its mobile apps.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, [photography](https://flickr.com/photos/_mdh), and the outdoors.
