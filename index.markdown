Hello! I'm a software engineer currently working at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com), where I focus on modernizing and scaling the support ticketing platform. Previously, I worked at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org), where I led API and service development to support new features on Wikipedia and its mobile apps.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, [photography](https://flickr.com/photos/_mdh), and the outdoors.
